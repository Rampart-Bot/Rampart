<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective Date: October 8, 2025</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Rampart Bot</strong> collects, uses, and protects your data when interacting with Discord servers.</p>

<h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
<p>The Bot may collect the following types of data to provide its functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Server metadata (guild ID, name, channels, roles) for snapshots and rebuilds.</li>
  <li>Basic user metadata (user IDs, usernames) for moderation purposes, such as spam detection and join flood prevention.</li>
  <li>Bot usage statistics, such as snapshot and rebuild counts, for analytics and website display.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To maintain snapshots and restore server data accurately.</li>
  <li>To monitor and respond to spam, raids, or disruptive activity.</li>
  <li>To display aggregated, anonymized statistics on our public website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All snapshots are stored locally on the bot's host or a configured storage system.</li>
  <li>User personal data (IDs, usernames) are not shared outside of the bot's moderation context.</li>
  <li>Snapshots older than the last 15 are automatically deleted, unless configured differently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>Rampart Bot does not sell, rent, or trade your data. Data may be shared with Discord or law enforcement only if required by law or as part of a security investigation.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect collected data from unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion. However, no system is completely secure.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can request removal of your server's snapshots by contacting the bot owner.</li>
  <li>You can revoke administrative permissions from the bot at any time, which disables data collection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of any changes. We recommend reviewing this page periodically.</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>For privacy concerns, please contact the bot owner via Discord or through official channels provided on the website.</p>
