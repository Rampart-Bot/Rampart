<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Effective Date: October 8, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Rampart Bot</strong>. By adding or using Rampart Bot ("the Bot") in your Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service ("ToS"). Please read them carefully. If you do not agree, you must not use the Bot.</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By using the Bot, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and these ToS. You confirm that you are authorized to accept these terms on behalf of your Discord server.</p>

<h2>2. Bot Usage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Bot provides automated server protection, snapshot backups, rebuilds, and moderation tools.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for using the Bot in accordance with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</li>
  <li>The Bot may require administrative permissions to function correctly. Grant permissions at your own discretion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Snapshots and Rebuilds</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Snapshots capture roles, channels, and categories to facilitate server restoration.</li>
  <li>Rebuilds restore your server to the state of a selected snapshot. The Bot cannot guarantee perfect restoration due to Discord limitations or permission hierarchies.</li>
  <li>Keep backups at your discretion. The Bot automatically manages the last 15 snapshots unless configured otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Server owners and administrators must ensure proper use of the Bot.</li>
  <li>Misuse, including deleting multiple channels to intentionally trigger rebuilds, may lead to liability for unintended disruptions.</li>
  <li>All users interacting with the Bot must adhere to Discord's Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available." The developers are not responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data loss, including but not limited to roles, channels, or messages.</li>
  <li>Downtime, errors, or bugs in the Bot.</li>
  <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from Bot usage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Modifications</h2>
<p>We may update these ToS at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Major changes will be announced in official channels.</p>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to restrict or remove the Bot from servers at our discretion, including for violations of these ToS or Discord rules.</p>

<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes will be handled in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p>By using Rampart Bot, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service.</p>
